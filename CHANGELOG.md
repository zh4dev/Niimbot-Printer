# Changelog

All notable changes to `niimbot_print` will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed false “Enable Bluetooth” warnings on iOS after granting Bluetooth permission or enabling Bluetooth.
- Wait up to three seconds for CoreBluetooth to transition from `unknown` or `off` to `on`.
- Fixed iOS label text rendering failures that caused the “Unable to draw label content” error.
- Preserve label font sizes when long text wraps onto two lines.
- Added explicit errors for missing font resources, font initialization failures, and print timeouts.

### Changed

- Updated iOS font initialization to follow the official Niimbot SDK v4.1.1 implementation.
- Updated drawing-board initialization to use `ZT001.ttf` through `fontArray`.
- Added a 30-second native print timeout.

### Added

- Added official iOS font resources: `FONT.json`, `ZT001.ttf`, and `ZT002.otf`.
- Added tests for delayed Bluetooth initialization and disabled Bluetooth states.
